## Lecture 1: Overview of Cloud Computing

This summary covers the key concepts from the "Lecture 01 - Overview of Cloud Computing" video.

### 1. Cloud Computing Hype and Growth

- Forecasting agencies predicted significant growth in cloud computing revenue (e.g., exceeding $150 billion by 2013).
- This led to increased investment and adoption by businesses and governments.

### 2. Evolution from Distributed Systems

- Growing demand for scalable computing and the rise of virtualization drove cloud computing's evolution.
- It emerged from earlier distributed systems like clusters, grids, and peer-to-peer networks.
- Cloud computing addresses large-scale problems and massive datasets.

### 3. Features of Cloud Services

- Massive Scale:
    - WUE = Annual Water Usage/IT Equipment Energy (low is good)
    - PUE = Total Facility Power/ IT Equipment Power (low is good)
- On-demand access
    - **Hardware as a Service(HaaS)**: Provides barebone hardware and machines.
    - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides fundamental computing resources (virtual machines, storage, networking, load-balancing).
    - **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform for developers to build and deploy applications(Execution Runtime, DBs, Web Servers, Dev Tools)
    - **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers applications over the internet.    
- Data Intensive:
    - Typically store data at datacenters and use compute nodes nearby. The focus therefore shifts from computation to data.
    - CPU utilization no longer the most important resource metric, instead I/O is (disk and/or network).
- New Cloud Programming Paradigms
    - MapReduce
    - Hadoop
    - NoSQL

### 4. Advantages of Cloud Computing

- **Cost Savings:** Reduced IT operational costs, no upfront hardware investments, pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Improved resource utilization through shared infrastructure.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Enhanced collaboration and data sharing.

### 5. Cloud Computing Technologies

- **Virtualization:** Enables multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server.
- **Hypervisors:** Manage and isolate virtual machines, enabling efficient resource allocation.

### 6. Public vs. Private Clouds

- **Public Clouds:** Provided by third-party vendors and accessible to the general public.
- **Private Clouds:** Built and maintained within an organization's data center.

### 7. Key Features of Cloud Computing

- **Massive Scale:** Large data centers with thousands of servers.
- **On-Demand Access:** Pay-as-you-go pricing and flexible resource provisioning.
- **Data-Intensive Nature:** Designed to handle large volumes of data.
- **New Cloud Programming Paradigms:** Frameworks like MapReduce and Hadoop.

### 8. Decision to Outsource or Own

- Factors to consider: cost, scalability, security, and control requirements.
